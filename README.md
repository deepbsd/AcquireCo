# AcquireCo

This is an app prototype for use as a code challenge on a job I'm being considered for.

It's a React app that displays a list of target companies under consideration for acquisition, along with a contact for each, some
light financial data, and a status of the current deliberations regarding that company's acquisition.

The App also allows you to create, update and delete data for each company.

Because of time constraints, this app will not get a back end, so changes to data will only be made to the React DOM.  Each time
the app reloads, the data changes will be lost (ie, no persistence).
